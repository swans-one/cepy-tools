def normalize_pinyin(pinyin):
    """Standardize pinyin strings to make comparison easier.

    Pinyin is a fairly well specified standard, but there are several
    ways of writing different pinyin characters

    "wǒ ài nà ge nǚrén" -> "wo3 ai4 na4 ge5 nu:3 ren2"

    Normalizations:
      - Distinguish pinyin from non pinyin by bracketing non-pinyin segments
      - Remove punctuation markers and extra spaces
      - Replace all diacritics with tone numbers
      - Ensure all pinyin have tone number by adding neutral tone (5)
        to un-toned pinyin words.
      - Remove capitals from pinyin (but not non-pinyin)
      - convert umlauts to cedict standard (e.g. nǚ or nv3 to nu:3)
      - Remove extra spaces and normalize to exactly one space between
        pinyin segments

    Examples:
      - "wǒ ài nà ge nǚrén" -> "wo3 ai4 na4 ge5 nu:3 ren2"
      - "Ta1men2" -> "ta1 men2"
      - "Wo3 shi4 Jane Doe." -> "wo3 shi4 [J] an5 e5 [Do] e5"

    *Note on non-pinyin, ambiguities, and missing tone marks*

    This function assumes that the pinyin entered is valid pinyin. It
    will attempt to continue working if non-pinyin characters are
    included. This is important because some cc-cedict entries include
    characters from the latin alphabet which are pronouced. See for
    example this cc-cedict entry:

    TF卡 TF卡 [T F ka3] /microSD card/

    Which would normalize to `"[T F] ka3"`. However, there are
    limitations to this approach as the following entry would not
    normalize as clearly:

    AA制 AA制 [AA - zhi4] /to split the bill; to go Dutch/

    This would normalize to `"a5 a5 zhi4"`, which is likely not the
    intended normalization. However, the main purpose of this function
    is to deal with pinyin, not non-pinyin, so some sacrifices have
    been made.

    Additionally, this function expects that pinyin be written
    unambiguously. While it will attempt to segment properly, if there
    is ambiguity it may not do what you intend. See for example, the
    several ways of writing Xī'ān:

      - "Xī'ān" -> "xi1 an1"
      - "xi'an" -> "xi5 an5"
      - "xian" -> "xian5"
      - "xīān" -> "xi1 an1"
      - "xīan" -> "xian1"

    This example shows that the normalization attempts to find the
    longest valid pinyin. This is handled in the pinyin standard by
    requiring any sylable starting with a vowel after the first
    syllable of a word be prefixed with an appostrophe (`'`) to make
    it clearer, even in instances where there's not technically an
    ambiguity.
